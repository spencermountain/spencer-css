    What's with these homies, dissing my girl?
    Why do they gotta front?
    What did we ever do to these guys
    That made them so violent?
    Woo-hoo, but you know I'm yours
    Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
    Woo-hoo, and that's for all time

    Oo-ee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly, Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore,
    I don't care what they say about us anyway
    I don't care bout that

    Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
    I know that you need help
    Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
    You need a guardian
    Woo-hoo, and you know I'm yours
    Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
    Woo-hoo, and that's for all time.
